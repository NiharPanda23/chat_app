Chat Application
This is a fully-featured chat application built using Next.js, Stream Chat API, and React. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and participate in real-time messaging with other users. It also supports features like user authentication, message notifications, and more.

Features

Real-time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
User Authentication: New users can sign up and log in with a username and password.
Persistent Sessions: Authentication tokens are stored in cookies to persist user sessions.
Media Support: Users can add profile pictures through avatar URLs.
Phone Number Verification: Users can optionally provide a phone number during registration.
Responsive Design: The UI is designed to work across different screen sizes.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, React, Stream Chat React
Backend: Stream Chat API, bcrypt for password hashing, crypto for user tokens
State Management: React useState and useEffect
CSS: Custom styling for the chat interface
Authentication: Token-based authentication generated using the crypto module and stored in cookies

Requirements
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm or yarn
Stream Chat account (for API keys)

Project Structure
/components: Contains reusable React components for the chat app, such as the Auth component for user sign-in/up and ChannelListContainer, ChannelContainer for the chat interface.
/public: Static assets like images.
/app/api: API routes, including user authentication logic.
/styles: Global and component-specific CSS

API Endpoints:

The application uses the following API routes for user authentication:

POST /api/signup: Registers a new user, creates a hashed password, and generates a user token using crypto.
POST /api/login: Authenticates an existing user and generates a session token using crypto.

Both routes require the following parameters in the request body:

fullName: User's full name (for sign up only)
userName: User's unique username
password: User's password
phoneNumber: Optional phone number (for sign up only)
avatarURL: Optional profile picture URL (for sign up only)
Authentication
The app uses tokens generated by the crypto module to authenticate users. When a user signs up or logs in, the token is stored in cookies for session persistence.

Key Libraries Used

Stream Chat: Provides the backend and real-time functionality for chat.
Next.js: A React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
React: The main library for building the user interface.
bcrypt: Used for securely hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
crypto: Used to generate unique tokens for user sessions.
universal-cookie: Used to manage cookies in the browser, enabling session persistence.

Known Issues

Hydration Mismatch: The app currently uses Next.js with dynamic imports for certain components, which can result in hydration errors if not properly handled. The issue has been mitigated by client-side-only checks for authentication tokens.
